I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Biostatistics Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG)](https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/organization/tdrp/bb), at the [National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH)](https://www.cancer.gov/). My research interests span the full breadth of statistical science, from theories and methodologies to applications and programming.

I earned my Ph.D. in Statistics at [Michigan State University](https://stt.natsci.msu.edu/), where I was co-advised by [Dr. Haolei Weng](https://haoleiweng.github.io/) and [Dr. Hyokyoung (Grace) Hong](https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/hong-grace).
