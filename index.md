I am a Postdoctoral fellow in the Biostatistics Branch of the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH). I am broadly interested in various statistical topics, from statistical theories to applications and programming.

I completed my Ph.D. in Statistics from Michigan State University (MSU), advised by Drs. Haolei Weng and Hyokyoung (Grace) Hong. Prior to MSU, I completed my B.A. and M.A. in Statistics from Konkuk University.
