I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Biostatistics Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH). My research interests span the full breadth of statistical science, from theories to applied methodologies and programming.

I earned my Ph.D. in Statistics at Michigan State University, where I was co-advised by Dr. Haolei Weng and Dr. Hyokyoung (Grace) Hong. Earlier, I completed both my B.A. and M.A. in Statistics at Konkuk University in South Korea, where I was advised by Dr. Hyoung-Moon Kim.
